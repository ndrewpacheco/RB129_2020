# The Object Model

## encapsulation
	
hiding functionality within a program so to not change the data without obvious intent. It is a form of data protection.


--what is a benefit of creating objects?

A programmer can work at a new level of abstraction. Objects are represented as real world nouns. They can have different behaviours via the methods created for them.


## polymorphism

gives us many flexible ways to represent the data in our code. Poly-morph means "many forms"
	
## inheritance
Gives us a way for classes to inherit, or take in, behaviors of another class, aka the superclass. 

This allows us to have classes that have large scale, common methods. As well as subclasses, which have fine-tuned and specific behaviors.
